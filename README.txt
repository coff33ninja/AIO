Information

Some scripts are entirely my own, while others include the work of others. Each one has a specific, clearly defined purpose, and unless noted, will work independently of the others. It has been setup so that it will automatically call and run as Administrator; and download the files as needed (just to keep system clear from extra clutter). The item in release was build with "update" in mind for when updates occur in the main AIO package gets updated. As a GRAND RULE OF THUMB it is always great to read the script code first.

Most of the code is still "Dirty" due to learning cmd, bat, vbs and ps1 creation from the ground up. Hope this will become an excelent toolkit for everyone in the future. Installer build with help of InstallForge v1.2.3! Aria2 pre-setup as download manager in AIO
