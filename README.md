Special thanks to:

Builtbybel https://github.com/builtbybel
and
massgravel https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts
and https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts

for the code, files and basis to work from.

most of the code is still "Dirty" due to learning cmd, bat, vbs and ps1 creation from the ground up.

Hope this will become an excelent toolkit for everyone in the future.
