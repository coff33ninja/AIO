# Note: 
This project has been dropped in favor of a new project: [NexTool-Windows-Suite](https://github.com/coff33ninja/NexTool-Windows-Suite).

This toolkit consists of various scripts: some are original creations, while others incorporate the work of other developers. Each script is purpose-driven and, unless otherwise specified, operates independently. It's set up to run as an administrator automatically and will download the necessary files on-the-go to maintain a clutter-free system. Ensure your Anti-Virus is disabled when using this application to avoid false positives; it can be re-enabled after the application completes its execution.

# üìã Prerequisites

  -  Active Internet Connection
  -  Windows PowerShell version 5.0 or higher
  -  .Net Framework 4.5 or higher
  -  For unmet requirements, see the Limitations section below.

# üöß Limitations & Instructions

If you face any issues, especially with the installer, please use the 'ARIA' version available in the [RELEASES](https://github.com/coff33ninja/AIO/releases) section. These limitations are mainly due to constraints in Windows and PowerShell. For the time being, most code updates are kept online, and there won't be frequent updates to installers or version numbers.
